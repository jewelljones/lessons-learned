One thing I learned was that there were a couple of ways to be lean (or simply save on costs) when it comes to entrepreneurial efforts while still focusing on creating value for a business:

<b>Websites and Mobile Apps:</b>  Regardless of whether a business decides it needs an actual website, mobile app or both, there are off-the-shelf services such as PhoneGap and Xamarin that can help business owners reach their audiences quickly as opposed to needing to use developers for custom application development work.  For example, if a business owner wanted to sell products online, the business owner's efforts would be better served by using Shopify or Etsy to prove first that the products would be bought by customers.  The business owner as a result would also learn about the e-commerce features that would be beneficial to have for its own business after a proof-of-concept phase.  Even for a business wanting to advertise services, it may not be necessary to build a website with many webpages; this would cost more to the business owner in terms of time for maintenance.  A simple and informational one-page website could just as easily meet the business need.

<b>Human Capital - especially developers:</b>  Eventually many businesses are going to need to hire people to grow and/or scale.  If a business is just starting out, it may not have enough funds to pay market rate for talent.  If candidates can't be wooed with the compensation, it may be best to sale them on the goals of the business.  This may also be the case for individuals, often software developers, who a business can pay well but are in demand by many businesses.  If businesses are in an area where hiring is cost-prohibitive, finding remote engaged workers is an option.  Even packing up and moving to a location where the talent is cheaper can be an option.

<b>Development:</b> When building software (or products) and choosing among a list of features to tackle first, it is important to prioritize the features first. Out of the high priority features, the team should look at building the riskiest feature first.  It will quickly help the team better focus on what is feasible in terms of costs and other available resources.  Martin Chavez, the CIO of Goldman Sachs, has his technology and development teams operate in a "download, build or buy" <a href = "http://recode.net/2015/07/16/goldman-sachs-cio-martin-chavez-comes-to-codeenterprise">(article here)</a> mode and in that order of preference.
