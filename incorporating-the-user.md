The key takeaway for me is remembering to incorporate the end user throughout the development process
It's an essential part of any product development process, but interestingly, often gets forgotten as creators get
increasingly focused on features.

I heard Mark Hurst, author of "Customers Included," speak about how we are all in an experience-driven industry.
It's true. Yet so many companies and designers forget that.
[Here's a link to some notes on the book](http://uxcellence.com/2014/07/17/notes-from-customers-included-by-mark-hurst/)

My favorite story, about Tupper Thomas and the restoration of Prospect Park, highlights the importance of simple tools like interviews and user stories
Tupper knew the city wanted to clean up the graffiti-riddled park, but decided to actually walk through the park, talk to the "users," and hear what their needs were
She found out that the people who really needed and used the park were dog walkers.
She was then able to formulate a plan, based on a user story, for the park's redevelopment
As a blank
I want blank
So that blank

As a dog walker
I want lots of walking paths
So that I can get through the park easily

It's an incredibly easy construct to remember and it can serve as a wonderful guide throughout the development process
Obviously, we saw how the same format can be used in website design and development
Perhaps you're an entrepreneur and you've got a great idea about to make meal planning and grocery shopping easier for moms.
A crucial phase of the development of your business would be establishing user stories and, in your next phase of incorporating the user, testing your hypotheses with interviews.

Overall, I think that managing development while remembering that success is based on your team's ability to establish and meet the needs of your customer will ultimately lead to 
not only a better product, but a better working relationship with the entire development team.
