<p> I learned from Digital Literacy, what should be considered when first deciding to start either with building an App or a Website. Factors such as the different availability of features, development costs and the time needed to build need to be taken into consideration. Even though there is no general answer, I will elaborate on certain influencing factors.

<p>If possible, one should always start with building a website, which is due to the cheaper price and because it takes less time to build. Still, these can be avoided by using software like Phone Gap, Cordova or Titanium Appcelerator. These minimize the time and costs needed for developing a website, with still being able to enjoy most of the benefits from building an App.

<h4>App:</h4>
Building an App allows better usability offline functionality, some App-only experiences and notifications. You can also take advantage of the “real-estate” on the devices Hardware which often leads to higher loyalty.

<h4>Website:</h4>
Additionally, the benefits one gets from building a website is the wider reach, less initial friction and a higher findability through search engines. After having decided to build a website however, it is essential to start with one single website and a mobile first approach. That means building one website that can be accessed from devices with different screen sizes. The website will adapt to the specific device and be responsive as the screen size changes. The mobile first approach describes the concept that a responsive website should always be build by starting with designing the mobile version and going from there to deciding how it should look on larger screens. Furthermore, websites can be updated automatically, whereas the updates for Apps need to be downloaded individually.

<h4>Time:</h4>
Building an app usually takes about 6 weeks, while a similar website takes up a fraction of that time. Furthermore, if an app takes more than 2-4 months to develop, it should typically not be done, since it makes it more difficult to apply the concepts and earn the benefits from “Incremental Software Development.md”.

Although these topics give a good idea about what should be taken consideration when deciding to build a website or an App, the final decision depends on the importance of each factor with regard to the individual project.
