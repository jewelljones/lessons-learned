Broadly, the most valuable takeaway from Digital Literacy is understanding the process that goes into developing tools that are an irreplaceable part of everyday life. However, as someone that hopes to apply digital applications to unlock value in conventional industries – incremental software development concepts were by far the most important.

For the inexperienced, the temptation of a fixed bid web design is high. In my mind, the hard part would be finding the idea that is going to provide customer utility and the easy part is the software/application design. By this logic one should be able to simply buy the delivery system that will provide the customer utility.

After Digital Literacy it is clear that incremental software development makes better sense. Most ideas that are going to deliver customer utility will mature over time and as a result require incredible flexibility in the delivery system. The flexibility requirement makes specifying software nearly impossible and creates situations that will lead to devoting too much time to “arguing verse coding”.

Moving forward, software development must take into account the same concepts of good project management. It then makes sense to communicate broad intent to your developer and create requirements that “don’t think of everything”. By implementing “working software” that is driven by frequent releases, it is more likely that the idea will mature without compromising the software, costs will be controlled, and the concept will work. 

Given that software development takes place over time and that trust is a key component it was helpful to discuss the places to find the right programmer as well as the working to define the right level of interaction. It helps to understand the value of paying market rate to a development group with an established name versus attempting to find an alternative (possibly less expensive) solution.
