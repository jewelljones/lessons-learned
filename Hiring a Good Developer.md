A key factor of launching a successful software start up or simply building a good programme is to hiring a good developer. One can identify good developers by ensuring they have some of the following traits:

* Character traits
  * Inquisitive
  * Early/quick adaptor to new ideas
  * Realistic
  * Cares about developing and does not give up when faced with problems
  * Good communicator
  * Finds the box instead of being limited by it
  
* Programming style
  * Writes dynamic, flexible and adaptible code
  * Uses some program (like Github) to collaborate within teams
  * Does not duplicate
  * Equipped with multiple means to debug effectively
  * Tests continuously and ruthlessly

This list is not comprehensive as good developers can come in many forms. However, it is a starting guide towards ensuring your software has the best chance of success!
